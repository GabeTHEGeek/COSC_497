Short - Project Analysis

What did you find most satisfying?

Learning to swap bitmap in and out. This was nice because I had very little experience using bitmaps and now feel I have a better understanding of how to use them a future project.

What did you find least satisfying?

Again, I can't say there was anything not satisfying. There was a few times I got stuck, but overall the project was a good learning experience. I guess if I have to pick something it would be learning to use the debugger to find out if I was generating enemies on the same bitmap or area. 

For example, I use Flash Develop when I could not figure out why I only would see one enemy spawn on the screen. I found out I was spawning the enemies to the same XY location of the bitmap instead of creating a new bit map texture.

What did you learn?

In this project, I learned how to use the bitmap class and change images dynamically. I also learned a few other things like how to track enemy directions using a 360 degree radius.

What did you fail at?	

I feel even though I completed this project, my programming skills need more work. I get the logic but when it comes to translating it to the programming it takes me longer than others.
