Short - Project Analysis

What did you find most satisfying?

Working and solving such problems as collision detection between the objects, the mouse, and the stage. I also had to do a lot of research on the concept of generating a object from it center. Once I realized how to do it, I solved the issue no problem.

What did you find least satisfying?
I can't say there was anything not satisfying. Every time I ran into a problem, it just made me think harder and get into the project more. I guess if I had to choose one it would be that I didn't get perfect collision on the object without the stage listening for a click. This made my score counter take away points instead of giving.

What did you learn?
In this project, I learned how to create an object based on it's specific X and Y properties independent from the stage.

What did you fail at?	
I failed at completely getting my logic to work during the collision between the object and stage.
