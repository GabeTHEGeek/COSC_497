What did you find most satisfying?
I really liked using the state machines method. I now know how powerful they can be for sprites, games screens, and changing inputs on the fly.

What did you find least satisfying?
Implementing the console. While I got it working, it was very frustrating. I had to reorganize the display manager to get it working properly.

What did you learn?
In this project, I learned mostly hot to use the state machines. Also I’m starting to feel more comfortable with using the input system to add more key presses.

What did you fail at?           
I did not complete the project on time and therefore could not get the bonuses. I got stuck on the console implementation for about a solid week.
